# How-Wage-Inequality-within-Clubs-Affects-Performace

Hello. Welcome to my investigation into the impact of a team's wage bill size on their domestic league performance, as well as how wage inequality between players within a club affects performance. 

## Inquiry

The size of a team's wage bill obviously has a great impact on how well a team performs. If a team can afford to pay the best players, they will, and will enjoy success in their domestic league. This project will look into to what extent wage bills affect domestic performance, and whether wage inequality within clubs positively or negatively affects team performance. 

## Data

Capology has free wage data for the top 5 leagues, based on a "network of insiders" and a complex algorithm. theFishy is a website with a robust database of final league tables from leagues across the world.
